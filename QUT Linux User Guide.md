# QUT Linux User Guide
As an MPhil student and a Linux (currently Ubuntu 20.04) user from Queensland University of Technology (QUT), I found Linux hardly officially supported (if any). So here I share my personal experience of accessing various daily QUT resources from Linux operating systems.

This guide is written and tested to work on Ubuntu 20.04 in May 2022 at Garden Points campus, and might be subject to future changes.

This guide was tested with a student account, things might vary if you're using a staff account.


## (Prerequisite) Access QUT Network
First step first, to access most QUT IT resources, you might need to first gain access to the QUT network, either on campus through QUT WiFi (or wired Ethernet) or off campus via Virtual Private Network (VPN).

### On Campus-Access QUT WiFi
As far as I know, this is the only thing where "official QUT instruction" is available and could be found here.

### Off Campus-Establish VPN Connection


## Set up QUT Email on External Mail Client

## Access QUT Remote Data Storage System (RDSS)


## Access QUT Printing Services
