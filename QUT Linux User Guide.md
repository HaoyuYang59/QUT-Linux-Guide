# QUT Linux User Guide
As an MPhil student and a Linux (currently Ubuntu 20.04) user from Queensland University of Technology (QUT), I found Linux hardly officially supported (if any). So here I share my personal experience of accessing various daily QUT resources from Linux operating systems.

This guide is written and tested to work on **Ubuntu 20.04** in May 2022 at Garden Points campus, and might be subject to future changes.

This guide was tested with a **student account**, things might vary if you're using a staff account.


## (Prerequisite) Access QUT Network
First step first, to access most QUT IT resources, you might need to first gain access to the QUT network, either on campus through QUT WiFi (or wired Ethernet) or off campus via Virtual Private Network (VPN).

### On Campus-Access QUT WiFi
As far as I know, this is the only thing where "official QUT instruction" is available and could be found [here](https://qutvirtual4.qut.edu.au/group/student/it-and-printing/wi-fi-and-internet-access/qut-wi-fi). Please note, most settings are **NOT default** so please check every entry carefully.

### Off Campus-Establish VPN Connection
1. Download VPN client-Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
Go to [this site](https://sas.qut.edu.au/), login with your QUT username and password to start the download.

2. Install VPN Client
Note: you would need **root privilege** to perform the installation with the following command:
cd $DOWNLOAD_POSITION  # change to download directory
sudo bash ./XXX.sh  # initialize the install script with root privilege

3. Launch VPN Client and Establish VPN Connection
VPN server hostname: remote.qut.edu.au
Username: (your QUT username)()
Password: (your QUT password)
